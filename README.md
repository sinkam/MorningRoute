This project is called MorningRoute and consists of a few morning errand stops before reaching Rankin Science for my afternoon classes. The route is mapped over a leaflet base map with dashed lines and waypoints of each stop that pop up a name when moused over. There is a text box with the title as well as a text box in the bottom right corner with a description of the route and a link to one of the stops website. The map is located within Boone, NC. The route was acquired using google maps and then converted using Maps to GPX and geojson.io. Most of the index.html code was provided by my professor Johnathan Sugg at Appalachian State University.
